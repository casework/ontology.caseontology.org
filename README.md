# CASE Automated Documentation Deployment

## Description

This repository provides automatic building and deployment of documentation resources
for the CASE ontology ([caseontology.org](https://caseontology.org)). Using this repository will allow an operator to pull the latest release, build [gendocs](https://github.com/lambdamusic/Ontospy) output, and serve the content via a Linux machine using [Apache2](https://httpd.apache.org). 


#### Contributions
Contained in CONTRIBUTE.md is details on how to submit changes to these works, and how to deploy the baseline configuration of the repository which you can build and test the effects of those changes. The deployment portion assumes you are using a Debian-based system *such as Ubuntu*, with Apache2 and an active network connection.


#### Future Work
Future work to the CASE Automated Documentation Deployment will add versioning support for the different tagged releases of CASE, so an operator may build a website that hosts previous versions of CASE.
